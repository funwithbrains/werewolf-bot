This will be a set of tools for playing games like Mafia and Werewolf.

Development goals from first priority to last:

1. Assist game masters with running their games.
2. Assist game masters with creating and sharing game setups.
3. Automate all game-master activity. This includes interacting with players in Facebook-based games via public posts in groups and private messaging.
  * We don't want to rely on NLP yet, so we'll require players to use unambiguous tags for to communicate with the automated GM.

Potential future goals:

* Analyze all possible paths for game-progression given zero evidence, and calculate the expected value for each player.
* Consider NLP-integration for the automated GM, if the unambiguous tags are not satisfactory.
